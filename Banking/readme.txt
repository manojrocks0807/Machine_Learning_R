A Portugese bank is rolling out term deposit for its customers. T
They have in the past connected to their customer base through phone calls. 
Results for these previous campaigns were recorded and have been provided to the current campaign manager to use the same in making this campaign more effective.

Challenges that the manager faces are following:

•  Customers have recently started to complain that bank’s marketing staff bothers them with irrelevant product calls and this should        immediately stop

•  There is no prior framework for her decide and choose which customer to call and which one to leave alone

The models are built to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a product or not?
